# BowlingScore
This is a program I wrote as a summer project in 2017.  I was inspired after being in a summer bowling league
to make this as I figured it would be a fun challenge to score bowling games.  The end result should be able to
automatically score a game like when someone misses a week of league and the frames are scored and ends with
a total score of their average - 10.

# Issues
currently not compiling due to trying to add pointers to add score to individual frames.
